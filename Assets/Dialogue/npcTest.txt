"Choose one"
    - "Option A" -> A               # This option links to the A label
    - "Option B" "This is B!" --    # This options puts it's code in-line
    - "Default Option"              # Options fall through by default

"This is the default!"  # Dialogue can have no options
--                      # This ends the dialogue

A:                      # This is the A label
